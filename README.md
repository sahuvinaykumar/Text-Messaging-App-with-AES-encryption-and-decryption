# Text Messaging App with AES Encryption and Decryption

This is a secure text messaging application built using **Java**, **XML**, and **Firebase**. It leverages **AES encryption and decryption** to ensure secure communication between users. 
The app uses Firebase as a backend for storing messages and user data, while AES encryption ensures that messages are securely encrypted before transmission.

## Features

- **AES Encryption & Decryption**: All messages sent through the app are encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to provide high-level security.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Firebase Realtime Database is used for storing and retrieving messages in real-time.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase Authentication is used to register and authenticate users.
- **Secure Communication**: Only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message, ensuring privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The main programming language for the appâ€™s logic and functionality.
- **XML**: Used for designing the UI and layout of the app.
- **Firebase**: Provides backend services including authentication, real-time database, and storage.
- **AES Encryption**: For encrypting messages before sending and decrypting upon receiving.
